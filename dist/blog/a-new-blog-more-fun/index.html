<h4 id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h4>
<p>Until today, I've used <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> for blogging, however I wasn't too much happy with it, I don't use all that features (photos, links, and so on), instead I need some more <em>power</em> when writing tech articles. That's also why I didn't write too much: every time I got some useful thing to say, I didn't want to go on tumblr.</p>
<p>After some thought, I decided to write my own blog engine, it was a decent excuse to play with <em>cool toys</em>. Then, a month ago I purchased a VPS on <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> and started playing with (well known) tools and solutions that I've never used, such as <a href="http://archlinux.org">Arch linux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn">unicorn</a> and <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/">monit</a>.</p>
<p>I've also imported some article from my <a href="http://andreapavoni.tumblr.com">previous blog</a>, as you can see, they were very rare, expect some more writings in the near future ;-)</p>
