#### A bit of history

Until today, I've used [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) for blogging, however I wasn't too much happy with it, I don't use all that features (photos, links, and so on), instead I need some more _power_ when writing tech articles. That's also why I didn't write too much: every time I got some useful thing to say, I didn't want to go on tumblr.

After some thought, I decided to write my own blog engine, it was a decent excuse to play with _cool toys_. Then, a month ago I purchased a VPS on [Linode](http://linode.com) and started playing with (well known) tools and solutions that I've never used, such as [Arch linux](http://archlinux.org), [unicorn](https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn) and [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/).

I've also imported some article from my [previous blog](http://andreapavoni.tumblr.com), as you can see, they were very rare, expect some more writings in the near future ;-)
