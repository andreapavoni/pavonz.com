title: "Rails4 StrongParameters with Devise and multiple resources",

description: "Rails 4 will use [StrongParameters](http://rubysource.com/rails-4-quick-look-strong-parameters/) by default. However, it doesn't seem that Devise is ready for this feature, even using its [rails4 branch](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/tree/rails4). There's a [good example](https://gist.github.com/kazpsp/3350730) that explains how to solve this problem when dealing with only one resource (eg: `User`). I forked that code to handle more resources (eg: `User` and `Admin`) without repetitions."

First of all, we override the controllers where we need to explicitly authorize params, in this case `PasswordsController` and `RegistrationsController` should accept `email`, `password` and `password_confirmation` by default:

```ruby
# app/controllers/custom_devise/password_controller.rb

class CustomDevise::PasswordsController < Devise::PasswordsController
  def resource_params
    params.require(resource_name).permit(:email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
  private :resource_params
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/custom_devise/registrations_controller.rb

class CustomDevise::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  def resource_params
    params.require(resource_name).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
  private :resource_params
end
```

Then, we need to tell Devise to use these controllers instead of the default ones:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

devise_for :users, controllers: {
  registrations: "custom_devise/registrations",
  passwords: "custom_devise/passwords"
}

devise_for :admins, controllers: {
  registrations: "custom_devise/registrations",
  passwords: "custom_devise/passwords"
}
```

enjoy :-)
