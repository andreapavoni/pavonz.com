### Intro

Unless you lived under a rock in the past 5 years or so, you should have already heard of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). In this article, we'll write a very simple web application with it to show its power and speed of development.

We'll cover the following topics:

- install Ruby
- install the rails gem
- how to start a new rails project
- directory structure of a rails project
- how to manage data with a database
- use already available components to handle common tasks
- add CRUD resources
- improve the app flawlessy

### Quick setup

The following section offers a very quick overview of the tools you need to get started with Ruby on Rails development. If you already have a working rails environment, excluding the default ruby installation that some operating systems have, then feel free to skip the steps.

#### Install Ruby

If you run Linux or MacOSX on your computer, you may already have Ruby installed by default, however these kind of installations are out of date (eg: ruby 1.8.x) and _gems_ are difficult to manage. The best way is to install it manually or just use some tool that helps to manage custom Ruby installations, even multiple versions (eg: 1.9.x and 2.0.0 releases).

Instead of repeating what others have already said, I will link some useful guides:

- MacOSX: [Ruby on Rails development with Mac OS X Mountain Lion](http://createdbypete.com/articles/ruby-on-rails-development-with-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/). Follow the steps until you reach _Install SQLite3_ section, we'll see here how to install rails.
- Linux: [Setup Ruby On Rails on Ubuntu 13.04](http://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu). Same as above, follow the steps until you reach _Configuring Git_.
- Windows: [SQLite3 Ruby 2.0 on Windows](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/4413168) and [Getting Started with Git and GitHub on Windows](http://kylecordes.com/2008/git-windows-go). I haven't too much experience on windows, so keep the finger crossed and/or ask on the same forum thread. The Ruby community is very kind :-)

Now, you should have all the requirements to get started.

#### Install Bundler gem

[Bundler](http://gembundler.com) is a [Ruby gem](http://guides.rubygems.org) that helps you to manage development dependencies in a project. We'll see how it works later, for now, just install it:

```
gem install bundler

```

#### Install Rails v4.0.0 gem

We're going to use the upcoming new version of rails. At the time of writing (mid june 2013), it's the _2nd Release Candidate_ but, according to its author, [it should be enough stable](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/344819888566702081).

**EDIT:** rails 4.0.0 is out, so don't use rc2.

```sh
gem install rails -v4.0.0
```

### A simple web application to manage and share bookmarks

Someone says that _doing it is the best way to learn_, so here's a _less common_ tutorial app: a simple platform to manage or share bookmarks. It's nothing fancy, but it's enough to apply some basic concepts. Moreover, aren't you bored about _todo lists_ and _blog engines_ over and over? :-)

#### Create the rails app

When you install rails, it comes with a bunch of other libraries and/or command line tools. The main one is `rails`. For now, we'll use it to generate the initial skeleton:

```sh
rails new bookmarks -T -d sqlite3 -B
```

I've also passed some arguments to the command:

- `-T`: skip `Test::Unit` files. It's not fundamental for our purposes (but they are in the everyday Ruby _and_ Rails development), so I skipped them because _testing_ is an argument apart and I don't want to overcomplicate this article.
- `-d sqlite3`: we want to use [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org) database. It fits perfectly for our purposes. Please note that, Rails has support for a wide variety of databases, even NoSQL ones. It's also common to have different database engines based on the environment (eg: SQLite for development, MySQL or PostgreSQL for production, etc...) without code changes.
- `-B`: don't run `bundle install`, we'll do it manually later.

Once you run the command, you should see a long list of lines that explain what is happening:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos % rails new bookmarks -T -d sqlite3 -B
create
create README.rdoc
create Rakefile
create config.ru
create .gitignore
create Gemfile
create app
[...]
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos % cd bookmarks
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks %
```

A new directory called `bookmarks` (or whatever name you passed) has been created, along with a set of files and directories inside it. Enter this directory, we'll see the important contents during the article.

#### A first look at Bundler and Gemfile

We mentioned Bundler as a tool to manage development dependencies in a Ruby app. It works by reading a file called `Gemfile` that should be present in the root directory of the app. You need this to make sure all the required gems are installed, even rails itself. Here's a brief look at the Gemfile generated by the `rails new` command:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Our rails version

gem 'rails', '4.0.0'

# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record

gem 'sqlite3'

# Use SCSS for stylesheets

gem 'sass-rails', '~> 4.0.0'

# Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets

gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'

# Use CoffeeScript for .js.coffee assets and views

gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.0.0

# Uncomment this if you haven't a nodejs and coffeescript installed

# gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby

[...]
```

As you can see, this is the default list of gems you need to start working on a Rails project. Of course, you'll change it very often to add, remove or upgrade gems.

Now you can finally run `bundle install` (the command we skipped by specifying `-B`):

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % bundle install
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..........
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Resolving dependencies...
Using rake (10.0.4)
Installing i18n (0.6.4)
[...]
Your bundle is complete!
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks %
```

If you use _git_, this is a good moment to initialize the repo and proceed with the initial commit.

#### Run the development server

Even if you haven't yet wrote any line of code, you can already use the Rails development server. Run the following command:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rails server
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.0.0 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2013-06-14 16:10:48] INFO WEBrick 1.3.1
[2013-06-14 16:10:48] INFO ruby 1.9.3 (2012-04-20) [x86_64-darwin12.2.0]
[2013-06-14 16:10:48] INFO WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=1174 port=3000
[...]
```

then point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll get a standard welcome page. This time we've used `rails server`, another useful command offered by Rails, moreover, it works only when you run it inside a Rails project folder. We'll see other useful commands later.

### A quick introduction to MVC patterns and Rails

Rails is usually defined as an _MVC framework_. Basically, it means that the app behaviour is defined in this way:

- **Model:** manages data between the rest of the application and the database. You can define how a single entity behaves, this includes data validation, before/after save hooks, etc...
- **Controller:** this is the _glue_ between the data managed by the Models and the rendered Views. Http requests that come to your app, are _routed_ to a controller which usually will interact with one or more models and finally renders the ouput along with an Http response.
- **View:** the final output for a request. It's usually a piece of HTML, but it might also be JSON or XML. We'll see this later.

This is, of course, an over-simplification, but it should be enough to get a _vague idea_ of how it works. I'll dive into some details later.

### Add a Bookmark resource

The goal of our app is to manage bookmarks, right? So we create our `Bookmark` resource:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rails generate scaffold bookmark title:string url:string
invoke active_record
create db/migrate/20130614142337_create_bookmarks.rb
create app/models/bookmark.rb
invoke resource_route
route resources :bookmarks
invoke scaffold_controller
create app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb
[...]
```

This time, we've used `rails generate`, one of the most useful commands. In this case, we've generated a _scaffold_ that creates all the necessary files and code to automatically get a full _MVC_ stack that manages a _Bookmark_. In the next paragraphs, we'll see in detail what did the above command.

#### Database migration

We've specified that a _Bookmark_ record is made of a _title_ and a _url_ fields, both of type _string_ (255 chars by default). So, the rails scaffold generator has automatically created a _migration_ script to update your database schema: `db/migrate/db/migrate/20130614142337_create_bookmarks.rb`

```ruby
class CreateBookmarks < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :bookmarks do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :url

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Even if it's almost easy to read, this code basically means:

- create a `bookmarks` table on database (note the pluralized form)
- it has the fields `title` and `url` of type string
- also add timestmps by default (this is automatically translated to `created_at` and `updated_at` datetime fields)

However, your database still doesn't know about these changes to the schema, you need to run the migration task:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rake db:migrate
== CreateBookmarks: migrating ================================================
-- create_table(:bookmarks)
-> 0.0011s
== CreateBookmarks: migrated (0.0012s) =======================================
```

[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) is another common and useful tool in the Ruby world. It acts like a _Makefile_ in a Ruby fashion. Rails comes with several _rake_ tasks ready to use (you can also create custom ones, if needed):

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rake -T
rake about # List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment
rake assets:clean # Remove old compiled assets
rake assets:clobber # Remove compiled assets
rake assets:environment # Load asset compile environment
[...]
```

#### The Boomark model

The model representing a _bookmark_ was created in `app/models/bookmark.rb`, at the moment it's almost empty in terms of code, but it already knows how to behave with the database. To demonstrate this, we'll use another Rails command to open a _console_:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rails console
Loading development environment (Rails 4.0.0)

>
```

Now, we have a shell to manually issue commands to our rails app. Let's see if it knows something about our _Bookmark_:

```sh
> Bookmark
> => Bookmark(id: integer, title: string, url: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)

> Bookmark.count

     (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "bookmarks"

=> 0
```

It knows about the _bookmarks_ table, its fields and how to query the database. Ok, create one _Bookmark_:

```sh
> Bookmark.create(title: "Hello Bookmarks app!", url: "http://localhost:3000")
> (0.1ms) begin transaction
> SQL (7.7ms) INSERT INTO "bookmarks" ("created_at", "title", "updated_at", "url") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?) [["created_at", Fri, 14 Jun 2013 15:16:17 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Hello Bookmarks app!"], ["updated_at", Fri, 14 Jun 2013 15:16:17 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://localhost:3000"]]
> (0.8ms) commit transaction
> => #<Bookmark id: 1, title: "Hello Bookmarks app!", url: "http://localhost:3000", created_at: "2013-06-14 15:16:17", updated_at: "2013-06-14 15:16:17"

> Bookmark.count
  (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "bookmarks"

=> 1
```

#### The BookmarksController and its views

We said that the _scaffold generator_ has created all the parts of the MVC stack, now is the time for the controller in `app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb`. You'll see a `BookmarksController` class and a bunch of methods (called _actions_). Each action corresponds to an HTTP PATH (eg: `/bookmarks`) and an HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

The autogenerated code is quite clear and, for brevity reasons, I can't dive too much in it. The interesting parts are:

- nowhere in the code is specified how to render views. There's a reason for that: html views are based on the controller's actions names. For example, `BookmarksController#show` will render a template placed in `app/views/bookmarks/show.html.erb`. Of course, only the actions that respond to _HTTP GET_ have a template, the rest are usually redirects. Check yourself the contents in `app/views/bookmarks/` to get an idea.
- it looks like there's some automagical _JSON_ support. That's true, rails supports _HTML_ and _JSON_ request by default, I'll show you this later.

#### Routes

The final component for the _MVC_ stack is about routing the _HTTP_ requests to the proper controller and action. To make this, the Rails generator has updated `config/routes.rb` file and has added the line `resources :bookmarks` that is a shorthand to say: _use [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) routes for the the resource bookmark_. If you're wondering _what_ routes, you can use the relative _rake task_:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rake routes
Prefix Verb URI Pattern Controller#Action
bookmarks GET /bookmarks(.:format) bookmarks#index
POST /bookmarks(.:format) bookmarks#create
new_bookmark GET /bookmarks/new(.:format) bookmarks#new
edit_bookmark GET /bookmarks/:id/edit(.:format) bookmarks#edit
bookmark GET /bookmarks/:id(.:format) bookmarks#show
PATCH /bookmarks/:id(.:format) bookmarks#update
PUT /bookmarks/:id(.:format) bookmarks#update
DELETE /bookmarks/:id(.:format) bookmarks#destroy
```

#### Try on the server

Now, the fun part. Restart your rails server with `rails server` and go to [http://localhost:3000/bookmarks](http://localhost:3000/bookmarks). If you followed the above example in console, you should already see the Bookmark created earlier, otherwise, you can create a new one by clicking on _New bookmark_ link.

Try [http://localhost:3000/bookmarks.json](http://localhost:3000/bookmarks.json) and see what you'll get. You still haven't written a single line of Ruby, and it already does a lot of things. Awesome, isn't it? :-)

### Adding users and authentication

Once we have the _Bookmark_ resource, we need _Users_ that own bookmarks and a way to authenticate them. The Ruby and Rails community is very active: whatever the task is, you'll probably find at least one gem to do it (if you don't, it might be a good idea to write one). Luckily, user authentication is a very common task, and there are several options. The most used is [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), let's use it.

#### Installing Devise gem

Open `Gemfile` and add this line:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 3.0.0.rc'
```

We also told Bundler to use a version of Devise that should be _greater_or_equal_ than its _minor version_ (eg: 3.0.1 is ok, 3.1.0 isn't).

Run `bundle install` to install the gem:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % bundle install
Resolving dependencies...
Using rake (10.0.4)
[...]
Installing devise (3.0.0.rc)
[...]
Your bundle is complete!
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks %
```

and run the Devise generator:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rails generate devise:install
create config/initializers/devise.rb
create config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
   is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
   in config/environments/development.rb:

   config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "localhost:3000" }

   In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

2. Ensure you have defined root*url to \_something* in your config/routes.rb.
   For example:

   root :to => "home#index"

3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
   For example:

     <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
     <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1+ on Heroku, you may want to set:

   config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

   On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
   or load models when precompiling your assets.

5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

   rails g devise:views

===============================================================================
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks %
```

As you can see, it has created two files under `config/` directory:

- `config/initializers/devise.rb`: here you can change several Devise settings. However, we'll use defaults because are enough.
- `config/locales/devise.en.yml`: this file contains i18n translations for Devise. Please note that `config/locales/` is the default path to put all the locales for a Rails app.

Devise also told us to check five steps to complete the setup:

- add `config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }` to `config/environments/development.rb`
- define a _root_url_ in `config/routes.rb`. Fow now, we can achieve this by pointing `BookmarksController#index` to the root of the site:

```ruby
Bookmarks::Application.routes.draw do
  # [...]

  root 'bookmarks#index'

  # [...]
end
```

- add the two pieces of html in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`. This file is the main layout your Rails app.

- skip the fourth step because we're running a Rails v4.0.x app, not a 3.1.x one)
- generate the Devise default views with `rails generate devise:views`. They contain a basic scaffold to get Devise work (eg: login/signup forms, etc...). Please note that Devise has several features concerning user authentication and registration, but we're going to use only a small set of them, so don't panic if you see a lot of generated views.

#### Generate a User model

Setup for Devise is done, but we still haven't a _User_ model, we need to create one:

```sh
andrea@mbair ~/Works/12dos/bookmarks % rails generate devise User
invoke active_record
create db/migrate/20130617132545_devise_create_users.rb
create app/models/user.rb
insert app/models/user.rb
route devise_for :users
```

If you remember the scaffold generator we used to generate a _Bookmark_, this one is very similar even if just focused on the model, plus the route that tells Devise to handle `/users/*` paths. In fact, it created a migration for users and the _User_ class. Edit the migration to look like this (remove or comment the rest):

```ruby
class DeviseCreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table(:users) do |t|
      ## Database authenticatable
      t.string :email, :null => false, :default => ""
      t.string :encrypted_password, :null => false, :default => ""

      ## Rememberable
      t.datetime :remember_created_at

      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :users, :email, :unique => true
  end
end
```

Also the model needs to reflect the changes made to the migration:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :rememberable, :validatable
end
```

The last step, is to run the migration with `rake db:migrate`

In this way, we have a simple authentication system that lets a user to register, login and logout. Try to run `rake routes` and you'll see the new routes for these actions, all referred to _users_. You can also play in the Rails console to create some user.

#### User has many Bookmarks

Now that we have _User_ and _Bookmark_, we need to _associate_ them. In this case, it's a _one to many_ relation. As a shared convention, foreign keys name are made of the model name suffixed by \_id. Of course, we'll not change the already created migrations, instead, we're going to create a new one:

```sh
rails generate migration AddUserIdToBookmark user_id:integer
```

Choosing an appropriate, arbitrary name is not mandatory, but it's a _best practice_ that you should follow. Our generated migration will add a _user_id_ integer column to the _bookmarks_ table. Also, feel free to run the migration now.

At the moment, no one of our two rails models knows about each other, we've only added a field on the database, but it's meaningless without some additional instruction:

- add `has_many :bookmarks` to `app/models/user.rb`
- add `belongs_to :user` to `app/models/bookmark.rb`

With these changes, a `User` instance will automatically have a `bookmarks` method (and many others), referred to all _Bookmark_ records with that specific _user id_.

#### Require authentication to manage your bookmarks

Looking at the models, it looks like the _data part_ is complete and working. However, the `BookmarksController` created by the scaffold command doesn't apply any authentication check, it needs some fix.

First of all, check user authentication before executing whatever action:

```ruby
class BookmarksController < ApplicationController

  # other before_actions

  before_action :authenticate_user!

  # [...] actions
end
```

This means that, from now, each request that arrives to the `BookmarksController` will first check if a user is authenticated (`authenticate_user!` is a method provided by Devise), otherwise it will be redirected to the login page.

Then, access only bookmarks owned by the authenticated user. To do this, replace `Bookmark` occurrencies with `current_user.bookmarks`. As you may wonder, `current_user` is an object provided by Devise that represents the authenticated user, while `.bookmarks` is the method provided by the model association between _User_ and _Bookmark_ models.

#### Try on the server

If you didn't played with the web interface yet, now it's a good time to do it. Here there're some hints:

- go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), it should redirect to [http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in](http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in), the login page;
- if you haven't registered any user, then go to [http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up](http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up) and register a new one;
- retry to go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) again, it will work as well as going to [http://localhost:3000/bookmarks](http://localhost:3000/bookmarks) because they're the same action;
- create some bookmarks from [http://localhost:3000/bookmarks/new](http://localhost:3000/bookmarks/new).

### Handling wrong inputs

At the moment, we have several areas where a wrong user input might damage you application:

- providing incomplete or malformed data when creating a new Bookmark
- requesting a bookmark id that doesn't exist as a record on the database, for example by visiting [http://localhost:3000/bookmarks/111](http://localhost:3000/bookmarks/111), will cause an error in your app, very ugly to see.

Let's see how to solve these issues.

#### Model validations

If you tried to use a password shorter than 8 chars or a bad formatted email during user registrations, you'd note that Devise has spotted those errors by not saving the record and rendering the user registration form again. In fact, Devise provided some default validations for users, but our app need validations on the `Bookmark` model too. Change `app/models/bookmark.rb` to look like this:

```ruby
class Bookmark < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  # ensure that a user_id is present
  validates :user_id, presence: true

  # ensure that title is present and at least 10 chars long
  validates :title, length: { minimum: 10 }, presence: true

  # ensure the url is present, and respects the URL format for http/https
  validates :url, format: {with: Regexp.new(URI::regexp(%w(http https)))}, presence: true
end
```

These validations are self-explanatory, so I'll not dive into them. Just keep in mind that there are many others or, in case, you can create custom ones.

#### When a resource is not found...

The second problem we addressed is about passing a wrong/non-existent identifier for a given resource. You can handle it in many ways, perhaps the simplest (and laziest) one is to redirect to the index, with a _flash message_. To do this, we only need to change some line of code in `BookmarksController`:

```ruby
class BookmarksController < ApplicationController

  # [...] other code here

  private # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.

  def set_bookmark
    unless @bookmark = current_user.bookmarks.where(id: params[:id]).first
      flash[:alert] = 'Bookmark not found.'
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end
end
```

The `set_bookmark` is a method called in a _before_action_ only for actions that need a resource id (show, edit, update, destroy). The new lines will safely check for existence on database, otherwise the user will be redirected to the root path of the site, with a short flash message.

### Improving the app one step at a time

Our app is almost complete, or at leats, it lacks several little details that make a difference. We'll try to address some of these. The goal, is to demostrate how to improve an existing app with small steps.

#### Add a better root page

This is a simple task. All we need is a new route, controller and view. This time, we'll use a generator dedicated to the controller:

```sh
rails generate controller site index
```

I've omitted the output because at the moment you should already guess what it did. In short, it has created a `SiteController` with an action called `index`, plus the related view in `app/views/site/index.html.erb` and a new route in `config/routes.rb`. However, the route should be changed to reflect our goal:

```ruby
Bookmarks::Application.routes.draw

# [...] other routes

# Comment/remove these lines

# get "site/index"

# root 'bookmarks#index'

# Use this

root 'site#index'
end
```

If you try to load [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you'll see the empty template of `app/views/site/index.html.erb`. To render content, we need to change the controller in `app/controllers/site_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class SiteController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # retrieve all Bookmarks ordered by descending creation timestamp
    @bookmarks = Bookmark.order('created_at desc')
  end
end
```

while the view in `app/views/site/index.html.erb`, might contain this basic markup as a starting point:

    <h2>Latest Bookmarks</h2>
    <table style="width: 100%">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Url</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
      <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
        <tr>
          <td><%= link_to bookmark.title, bookmark.url %></td>
        </tr>
      <% end %>
      </tbody>
    </table>

Again, note how the controller processes the request by retrieving some records from the database through the model `Bookmark`, then renders its view that contains the proper data to show the bookmarks.

#### Prettier GUI

Being a programmer, I haven't too much skills in design and layouts, but there are several CSS frameworks that help a lot. Instead of picking the famous [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), I chose [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), just to be fancy. There are a lot of ways to integrate existing CSS/Javascript frameworks and libraries inside a Rails app, the simplest one, is to use a gem when possible. Luckily, there's one for Zurb Foundation, just add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zurb-foundation', '~> 4.2.2'
```

run `bundle install`, plus its install generator:

```sh
rails generate foundation:install
```

this command, will ask you to overwrite your default application layout in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`, press _Y_ without worries. For brevity reasons, I've put the contents of the file [here](https://gist.github.com/andreapavoni/87e2c7261abeeb1ccf9d).

Moreover, we can also remove old scaffold's stylesheets:

```sh
rm app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss
```

#### Prettier forms

Forms are still ugly and boring to write, so we'll use [another useful gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) (from the same authors of _Devise_) to mitigate the problem. Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_form', '~> 3.0.0.rc'
```

run `bundle install` and the install generator (note that it already supports Foundation's markup structure):

```sh
rails generate simple_form:install --foundation
```

We'll also re-generate _Devise_ views, because it supports _SimpleForm_:

```sh
rails generate devise:views
```

The generator will ask you if you want to overwrite existent files, press _Y_ because that's what we really want.

The last step is to fix the _Bookmarks_ form, it wasn't updated by the other generators, we'll do it manually by overwriting its (partial) template in `app/views/bookmarks/_form.html.erb` with the following content:

    <%= simple_form_for(@bookmark) do |f| %>
      <%= f.error_notification %>
      <div class="form-inputs">
        <%= f.input :title %>
        <%= f.input :url %>
      </div>

      <div class="form-actions">
        <%= f.button :submit %>
      </div>
    <% end %>

#### A welcome page

It would be _professional_ to show a welcome page for non-registered users. To keep things simple, I'll use the same `SiteController#index` used for the root page. Modify `app/views/site/index.html.erb` to look like [this](https://gist.github.com/andreapavoni/98eeca9a0979c5802eb3).

### Conclusions

Congratulations! If you carefully followed all the steps, you should have a basic, yet working, Ruby On Rails app. Of course, this is only the _tip of the iceberg_: for brevity reasons, I've oversimplified some concepts, and I've skipped several important aspects (eg: using CSS/SASS and Javascript/Coffeescript, testing, deploy, etc...) that you should know if you want to be a proficient Ruby On Rails developer. However, as you can see, this happened to be already a huge article, at least in terms of lenght :-P

I've uploaded the _complete app_ on github: [https://github.com/andreapavoni/12dos-bookmarks](https://github.com/andreapavoni/12dos-bookmarks). It's a bit different from the one we wrote here, but it also adds some more features:

- pagination with [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) gem
- use _profile pages_ to show single user's bookmarks

Clone or fork the code and experiment with it.
